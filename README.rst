Playbooks
-------

This set of playbooks integrate with the os-ansible-deployment project to deploy the PLUMgrid Controller and Compute components that help manage the PLUMgrid neutron plugin. The plugin itself must be enabled through the os-ansible-deployment neutron playbooks as follows.

1. Set the following parameter to ``plumgrid`` in the ``rpc_deployment/inventory/group_vars/neutron_all.yml`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

  # Neutron Plugins
  neutron_plugin_type: plumgrid


2. Also in the same file, disable the installation of all neutron-agents in the ``neutron_services`` dictionary, by setting their ``service_en`` keys to ``false``

3. The PLUMgrid playbooks can then be pulled into the main deployment repository by adding the following lines to ``ansible-role_requirements.yml``


.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: PLUMgrid
      src: https://github.com/plumgrid/plumgrid-ansible
      version: master
